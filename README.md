BCM21553 common Kernel
======================

New project started by BroadcomCM organisation. This project is based on the final port of a common kernel capable of running on mainly 3 devices:
	* Galaxy Ace i - s5830i
	* Galaxy Mini i - s5570i
	* Galaxy Y - s5360

**This project is really WIP.**

We are not trying to give a basic kernel, we are trying to give you the **best** kernel out there compatible with all BCM21553 devices.

***NOTE:** This kernel is based on Cooperve CHN sources and at the moment it is just compatible with cooperve.*

REMEMBER: Make sure to perform the clean commands and remove all .* or the *~ files you editted before pushing the source up.

Purpose:
--------
On BCM21553 development, there has not been any good detailed kernel that people can learn from it. We are this kind of project. Commits will be detailed and clean as much as possible to give user a better expierence on reading and learning from them.
